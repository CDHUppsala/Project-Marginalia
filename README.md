# Project-Marginalia

This is a PyTorch implementation to find marginalias, segment words, and label them using the AttentionHTR [1] network. The network to find marginalias is based on a Faster R-CNN network. The network was trained on scanned book pages from Uppsala library.  

## Dependencies 

To run the code, run the following

```
python3 -m venv marginalia-env
source marginalia-env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r Project-Marginalia/requirements.txt
```


## Demo of our pre-trained model

### Marginalia prediction
* Download the pre-trained model `faster_r_cnn_weights.pt` from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_snBot1ZguCXwiy475NzU1Hwr6y_cLt6 and place it into `/Project-Marginalia/model/`.
* Create the folder `Project-Marginalia/model/data/test_images/` and place in them the test images.
* Create the folder `Project-Marginalia/model/results/`
* To predict and visualize the marginalias, run ```python3 model/test.py```

### Marginalia Segmentation
* If you want to use your model on your own set of images, use the image_to_bboxes.py script. In it you will have to add the path to your model, folder of your dataset, and the location where you want the predicted marginalia to be saved. Then run 'python3 image_to_bboxes.py'.
* If you want to segment a set of marginalia to individual words, use the marginalia_to_words.py script. In it you will have to add the path to a folder containing images of predicted marginalia, as well as the folder where you want the results to be saved. Then run 'python3 marginalia_to_words.py'.

### Word labelling with AttentionHTR
* To label the words with AttentionHTR, follow the instructions from https://github.com/dmitrijsk/AttentionHTR
